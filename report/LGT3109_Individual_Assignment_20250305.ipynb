    "\n",
    "**Background**:You are asked to extract information from the LMS staff webpage (see the figure below) at https://www.polyu.edu.hk/lms/people/academic-staff/ to make a contact directory in an excel worksheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = 'fig1.png' width=400>\n",

    "<img src = 'fig2.png' width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "**A pure manual approach:** You can make the contact directory manually by the following steps:\n",
    "1.\tCreate a new excel file dir-lms.xlsx in the report folder (i.e., E:\\LGT3109\\A\\report\\ of the remote desktop), and add the title and headers of the four columns to a worksheet for the contact directory\n",
    "2.\tOpen the browser Chrome to visit the LMS staff webpage at https://www.polyu.edu.hk/lms/people/academic-staff/\n",
    "3.\tFor each staff shown in the web page, \n",
    "    - (a)\tcopy his/her name (together with title) and paste it to the column A of the excel sheet\n",
    "    - (b)\tcopy his/her email and paste it to the column B of the excel sheet\n",
    "    - (c)\tcopy his/her telephone and paste it to the column B of the excel sheet\n",
    "    - (d)\tcopy his/her room number and paste it to the column B of the excel sheet\n",
    "4.\tAdjust the format of the worksheet, including column widths, fonts, etc. Save the excel file of the contact directory\n",
